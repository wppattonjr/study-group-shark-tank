# Shark Tank
This project was for me to create my own version of Pinterest. I was tasked to flex my CRUD muscles to create board, add pins, delete boards and pins, update boards and pins, as well as update boards and pins.

## Description

The members of Evening Cohort 13 have been dropped into a shark tank. When the user clicks on the "shark attack" button a member of the cohort is chosen at random. That person meets their end and is placed in the graveyard.
